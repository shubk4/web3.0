Centralization refers to the process in which activities involving planning and decision-making within an organization are concentrated to a specific leader or location.
Decentralization refers to the transfer of control of an activity or organization to several local offices or authorities rather than one single one.
that is why in this program i have used decentraisation.

here are some disadvantages of centralised system:
* Centralized management resembles a dictatorial form of leadership where employees are only expected to deliver results according to what the top executives assign them. 
* The organizationâ€™s executives are under tremendous pressure to formulate decisions for the organization, and they lack control over the implementation process.
